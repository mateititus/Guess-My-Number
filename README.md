# Guess-My-Number

This is a little game where I learned and experienced with DOM in JS.

Rules: 
- You need to guess a random number between 1 and 20
- If you are guessing to low or high you will have a message that says that
- If you are not writing a number it's going to show a message aswell
- If you guess the number you will receive a message and the highscore will be changed.
- To play again hit restart, the highscore won't reset only if you reload the game.

How to play:

1. Download the files
2. Open index.html / Open a live server in JS.
